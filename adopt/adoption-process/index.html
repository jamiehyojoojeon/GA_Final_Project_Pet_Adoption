					ready, one of our adoption counselors will help you through the process. We are here to help 7 days

					<div class="process-list">
						<ul>
							<li>The adoption interview and paperwork usually takes about an hour to complete (including
								waiting time) and you will take your adopted animal with you when the adoption paperwork
								is completed. Please do not try to adopt in a hurry.</li>
							<li>Adoptions are cut off every day about 30 minutes prior to closing and possibly earlier
								if volume is high. Weekends are busy and you may have to wait more than an hour
								(especially in the afternoons) so please be prepared.</li>
							<li>AHS does not hold animals and all adoptions are done on a first come, first served
								basis. Certain exceptions may apply.</li>
							<li>AHS accepts debit cards, credit cards and cash for adoption fees; we do not accept
								personal checks.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="process-list-btn"><i class="fas fa-paw"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic Requirements for Adoption
					</div>
					<div class="process-list">
						<ul>
							<li>Adopters will be asked to complete a preliminary adoption questionnaire.</li>
							<li>Adopters must be 18 years old with a valid picture I.D.</li>
							<li>If you lease or rent, get permission from your landlord or the primary resident prior to
								adoption. AHS reserves the right to contact your landlord for verification.</li>
							<li>Meet and greets are not required of all animals but may be deemed necessary by AHS
								staff.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="process-list-btn"><i class="fas fa-paw"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption Fees</div>
					<div class="process-list">
						<ul>
							<li>The cost for AHS to care for our animals prior to adoption almost always exceeds the
								adoption fee.</li>
							<li>Not all of our adoption pricing is the same. The reason for this is to ensure that AHS
								has the ability to care for those animals in great need, including who require extensive
								rehabilitation and/or are in our care for an extended period of time.</li>
							<li>What is a Plus One adoption fee? These are animals who are in high demand and whose
								adoption fee includes that of another harder-to-adopt animal in AHS care. Therefore,
								people who adopt a Plus One animals are not only directly changing the life of the
								animal they are taking into their home but also another animal in the shelter who needs
								extra help in finding that second chance.</li>
							<li>The adoption fee for each animal will be listed on their adoptable page on our website.
							</li>
							<li>Our adoption fees are designed to ensure that AHS is able to provide necessary care for
								all of our animals- especially those who need more time and care before they’re
								available for adoption.</li>
							<li>30 days of PetFirst Pet Insurance</li>
							<li>Initial vaccinations and deworming</li>
							<li>Spay or neuter</li>
							<li>Healthy Start Certificate at VCA Animal Hospitals towards initial exam and health
								guarantee within 10 days of adoption</li>
							<li>An identifying microchip inserted under your pet’s skin with initial registration in the
								database</li>
							<li>A collar and Atlanta Humane Society identification tags</li>
							<li>A 4 pound bag of the Purina One dry food the animal has been eating during his or her
								stay with AHS</li>
						</ul>

					<div class="process-list-btn"><i class="fas fa-paw"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequently Asked Adoption
						Questions</div>
					<div class="process-list">
						<ul>
							<li><span>I saw an animal online, is it still available? </span>Our website is updated in
								real time as animals come and go from the adoption floor. As long as the animal’s
								information is listed, the animal is currently available for adoption. Please note that
								there are times when an animal is in the process of being adopted and will be
								momentarily unavailable but still listed on the website until the adoption is submitted
								in our system.</li>
							<li><span>I am on the way to adopt that animal, can you hold it for me? Can I pay the
									adoption fee today and come back later to pick it up? </span>AHS does not hold
								animals and all adoptions are done on a first-come, first-served basis. Once the
								adoption is completed and the fee is paid, you must take the animal with you at that
								time.</li>
							<li><span>What is your return policy?</span> AHS believes in finding permanent, loving homes
								for animals and does not offer “trial” adoptions. We do, however, understand that
								sometimes an adopted animal turns out to be a poor match for their new home. Animals
								adopted from Atlanta Humane Society may be returned at any point during their life to
								the admissions department which is open 7 days a week from 9am-3pm. Animals adopted from
								Atlanta Humane Society will be admitted under any circumstances, unless State law or
								Local ordinances dictate otherwise. The animal must be returned by the person that
								adopted the animal. I may return the animal, for any reason, within 30 days for a ONE
								TIME ONLY- EXCHANGE, at AHS’s discretion. AHS will honor this ONE TIME exchange for up
								to 60 days. If another adoption is not appropriate or the exchange expires, then the
								adoption fee will be considered a donations. NO REFUND WILL BE GIVEN.</li>
							<li><span>How big will this puppy get?</span> Puppies can be expected to grow to 6-8 times
								their weight at 8 weeks of age. AHS staff may give you an estimate of your puppy’s adult
								weight but we are unable to make any guarantees. If size is a large concern, please
								consider adopting a fully grown adult dog.</li>
							<li><span>What should I bring with me to adopt?</span> Please be sure to bring a photo ID
								and cash or a credit card for the adoption fee (personal checks are NOT accepted). The
								primary caregiver is required to be present to go through the adoption process. Any
								children 5 and under and, in some cases, any existing dogs living in the home will be
								required to be present and meet the animal prior to adopting. Meet and greets are not
								required but may be deemed necessary by AHS staff.</li>
							<li><span>I saw an animal that I’m interested in on your website but it doesn’t have any
									photos. Can you send me some? </span>AHS relies on our volunteers to take photos for
								us and we post them as soon as we are able to, usually within a few days of the animal
								coming available for adoption. Highly adoptable animals are frequently adopted before
								any photos are posted so interested adopters are discouraged from waiting for a photo to
								come meet any animal they are interested in adopting.</li>
							<li><span>Can you tell me this animal’s history? Is it housebroken? Does it get along with
									cats, other dogs or children?</span> AHS will share whatever information is
								available about an animal’s previous home(s) during the adoption process but we rarely
								know their entire history. Just because an animal was reported to be housebroken and get
								along with children in the last home, doesn’t necessarily mean they will act the same in
								their new home. Adopters should be prepared to do some housetraining with any animal
								adopted from us. Children and other dogs living even part time in the home are
								encouraged to meet the dog prior to adoption to help determine compatibility.</li>
							<li><span>I’m wanting to adopt a dog, but why do you require my dog to live indoors?</span>
								Proper socialization of your new pet is essential to his or her new life with you. Pets
								will need to be a part of your family unit to help prevent behavior and socialization
								issues which can arise from a lack of interaction. In order to create the proper bonding
								with your pet, he or she will need to live with you indoors and is a part of our
								adoption requirements.</li>
