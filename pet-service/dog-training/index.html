				<h1>Dog Training</h1>
				<p><strong>Dog Training Courses Offered At the Atlanta Humane Society</strong></p>
				<p>The Atlanta Humane Society offers a variety of classes for first timers as well as more advanced dog
					students and their owners. The introductory Basic Obedience Class is a six week course that will
					give
					you the knowledge to have a more rewarding relationship with your dog. Classes are held once a week,
					for
					about one hour per session.</p>
				<p>AHS also offers Intermediate Obedience Classes that are designed to follow the Basic class, and
					prepare
					you for public places with your companion, including cafes, parks and other dog-friendly gathering
					spots. For a dog who isn’t suitable for class, or for those people whose schedules cannot
					accommodate a
					class, we also offer private training lessons at both AHS locations.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also offer free behavioral assistance through email for dog and cat owners.
					If you need something we do not provide, email us and we can probably point you in the right
					direction.

							<h3>BASIC OBEDIENCE CLASSES</h3>
							<p>
								The Atlanta Humane Society’s Basic Obedience classes give you the knowledge to have a
								more
								rewarding relationship with your dog by showing you how to teach your dog how best to
								behave
								in your household. Lessons include: pay attention, sit, stay, walk on leash without
								pulling,
								lie down, wait, come (all on leash), and more—though classes are NOT just about
								“commands.”
							</p>
							<p>
								Classes last six consecutive weeks from the start date, once weekly, for about one hour
								per
								session, and homework is required. The object is to communicate more effectively with
								your
								pet and bond with him through rewards such as attention, praise, and treats, and keep
								him on
								the right track with positive leadership. Though specific “problem behaviors” such as
								chewing, excessive digging, or barking are not specifically covered, you will find that
								many
								of these behaviors disappear once you begin interacting with your dog using the proven
								methods we teach. Even dogs who already have a pretty good grasp of these commands can
								benefit from the socialization and added distraction of class, as well as our exclusive
								Leadership Protocols and Self-Control Exercises. It is never too late to have a great
								relationship with your dog!
							</p>
							<p>
								AHS Basic Obedience Classes are a great bargain at only $139 for the full 6-week session
								(though they are worth twice that) and include things other classes do not.
							</p>

							<h3>Intermediate Obedience Classes</h3>
							<p>
								The Next Step class is a great way to take the foundation of training you and your dog
								have
								begun with the Atlanta Humane Society to the next level. It is designed to prepare you
								to
								take your dog out in public and enjoy cafes, parks, picnics, or other dog-friendly
								gathering
								spots, knowing your pooch will walk nicely next to you and then calmly lie next to your
								chair—even as strangers, other dogs, and other distractions surround you. We work on
								extended stays with major distractions, on- and off-leash recalls, better leash skills,
								a
								“place” command, and a “meet and greet” exercise that teaches your dog to control
								himself
								during human interaction.
							</p>
							<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
							<p>
								Graduation from the Atlanta Humane Society Basic Obedience Class within the last 24
								months;
								or completion of at least (4) hours of private instruction via Private Behavior Lessons
								at
								the Atlanta Humane Society (more may be required depending on homework follow-through,
								dog’s
								age, and dog’s temperament). Basic Training Classes are not all alike. While we
								appreciate
								any training you have done with your puppy or dog so far, our Intermediate Class is only
								for
								dogs trained at the Atlanta Humane Society. It is not suitable as a follow-up to classes
								taken elsewhere because it is designed to naturally flow from our Basic Training Class
								(or
								private lessons), and because we teach protocols in our Basic Class that other places do
								not.
							</p>
							<h4>Cost</h4>
							<p>
								The “Next Step” Intermediate Classes are just $85 for the 4-week session (all including
								dogs; this class does not have an orientation). All classes last one hour (pre-class
								socialization starts 15 minutes prior to start time for applicable dogs) and take place
								at
								the Howell Mill Campus, located at 981 Howell Mill Rd. N.W. in Atlanta, or at the
								Mansell
								Campus, 1565 Mansell Rd., Alpharetta, GA 30009. Classes are taught in the Shelter
								parking
								lot, though we have a backup area inside in the event of inclement weather. The final
								class
								(Week 4) moves from the Shelter to a public venue close by for the Graduation ceremony,
								so
								that your dog can show off his skills in public!

							<h3>Private Dog Training</h3>
							<p>
								You have a dog. You love your dog, but he has a few…quirks, let’s call them. And you’d
								rather he not. You see, dogs don’t have problem behaviors, really. Dogs just have
								behaviors.
								When we don’t appreciate those behaviors, we label them “problems.” One man’s problem
								behavior is another man’s “oh, isn’t that adorable!” (Yeah, it’s adorable when it ain’t
								happening to you, buddy.)
							</p>
							<p>
								So before you go labeling Fido’s behavior as “problem,” you need to understand that Fido
								has
								absolutely no problem whatsoever with anything he does. Everything he does makes perfect
								sense to him, even if you have no earthly idea why he does it. He doesn’t label his
								behaviors; he just behaves. The problem is not the dog’s…it’s ours.
							</p>
							<p>
								Does that mean you are stuck with Fido’s…quirks? Not typically. Dogs need to know how to
								live in our homes safely and happily, and most “problem behaviors” can be solved with
								the
								right approach and some consistent work from you. We are here to help you!
							</p>
							<p>
								Classes last six consecutive weeks from the start date, once weekly, for about one hour

								the right track with positive leadership. Though specific “problem behaviors” such as

							<p class="private-lessons">
								All private lessons are held <strong>at the Atlanta Humane Society, either at the Howell
									Mill Campus or the Mansell Campus.</strong> They are taught by our Behavior &
								Training
								Manager Mailey McLaughlin, M.Ed., who has over 30 years of experience working with dogs
								and
								their people. They are by appointment, typically during the day. Most slots (Saturdays
								especially) fill up quickly.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>PRIVATE LESSONS</strong> are by appointment and are <strong>1 hour each</strong>
								(approximately) and the cost is <strong>$75</strong> . Don’t let the low price fool you!
								The
								instructor is very knowledgeable and has decades of experience.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>ASSESSMENTS</strong> are approximately <strong>35-40 minutes</strong> and the
								cost
								is <strong>$49.</strong> They are by appointment only. The instructor will assess your
								dog
								and give you her recommendations for whether classes, or private lessons, would be best,
								and
								how she would work with you and your dog. NOTE: no instruction is included in the
								assessment, but we do give advice willingly.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Payment</strong> is required to hold a lesson spot, as spots fill quickly. Once
								you
								have arranged a time and date with the instructor, she will send you a link to pre-pay
								online with a credit or debit card.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Lessons and assessments</strong> are done on the following days and begin at the
								times listed. Please email us with your general availability, and we will respond with
								specific dates and times to fit your criteria.
							</p>
							<p class="training-p-color">
								<strong>Typically, Saturdays and Wednesday evenings fill first. If you have daytime
									availability Tuesday-Thursday, you will likely get in sooner.</strong>
